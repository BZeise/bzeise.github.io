# Readme for Personal Site

Thanks for coming to my website.  This site is built using only JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.  There's a basic implementation of CSS Flexbox, which will be the next piece to be upgraded.

Currently learning API Design with Node.JS and GraphQL... not sure how I'll implement that here :)

Back at it.  I'll make this a bit of a journal.  Time to implement a mobile responsive design.  Yep!
